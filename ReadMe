This program randomly generates a three digit number. The 
user has eight tries to guess the code. After each guess, 
the program gives feedback on if the number is too high/low, 
how many digits are correct and in the correct position, and 
how many are correct but in the wrong position. The user can 
quit by entering q. Three function prototypes will be above 
the main function and their full bodies will be on the bottom
of the file.
